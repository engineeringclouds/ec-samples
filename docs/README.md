# Documentation

Contributor guides, architectural notes, design decisions, and other reference material supporting the samples in this repository.

Recommended structure:

- `docs/guides/` - how-to articles for authors and maintainers.
- `docs/reports/` - deeper technical explorations or retrospectives.
- `docs/adr/` - architecture decision records (if applicable).

Keep documentation up to date with the samples and link back to relevant blog posts.
