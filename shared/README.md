# Shared Assets

Reusable helpers, sample data, container images, and other building blocks that are consumed by multiple samples or snippets.

Structure suggestions:

- `shared/lib/` for common code modules packaged per language.
- `shared/data/` for CSV/JSON fixtures.
- `shared/images/` for diagrams or architecture visuals.

Document any breaking changes to shared assets in `CATALOG.md` and notify maintainers when updates might impact existing samples.
