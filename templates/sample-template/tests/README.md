# Tests

Add instructions or scripts that validate the sample. Examples:

- `pytest` or other language-specific test suites.
- Bash scripts that provision and validate resources end to end.
- Links to GitHub Actions workflows that exercise the sample.

Document how to run the tests locally and include expected runtime.
