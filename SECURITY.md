# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Sample code in this repository is provided for educational purposes. We do not issue formal release versions, but we aim to maintain active samples that are referenced by current blog posts. Deprecated samples will be marked clearly in their `metadata.yaml`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any sample or supporting asset:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
2. Email `security@engineeringclouds.io` with the details of the vulnerability, affected samples (paths or blog links), and any steps to reproduce.
3. Encrypt sensitive information if possible. We can provide a PGP key on request.

We will acknowledge receipt within five business days and work with you on the next steps. If the issue pertains to code that depends on a third-party service or library, we may coordinate with that provider.

## Disclosure Process

- We will assess the report and determine impact on readers.
- Fixes or mitigations will be developed and validated.
- When appropriate, we will publish an advisory in this repository and update the associated blog post with remediation guidance.

Thank you for helping keep the EngineeringClouds community safe.
