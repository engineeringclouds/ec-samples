# Tooling and Automation

Automation scripts for linting, packaging, validation, and other contributor workflows.

Common scripts may include:

- `check.sh` - orchestrates repo-wide linting, formatting, and tests.
- `generate-catalog.py` - regenerates `CATALOG.md` or other manifests.
- `validate-sample.py` - smoke-tests a specific sample directory.

Document usage and prerequisites in this folder. Prefer cross-platform tooling (Bash + PowerShell) where possible.
