# Snippets

Small, copy-ready fragments that illustrate a focused concept. Snippets do not need full project scaffolding, but they should contain clear usage notes.

Organize snippets by language and topic, for example:

```
snippets/
  python/
    async-http-client/
      README.md
      snippet.py
  bicep/
    secure-storage-account/
      README.md
      main.bicep
```

Include a brief `README.md` in each snippet directory with:

- What the snippet demonstrates.
- Dependencies (SDK versions, CLI tools).
- Steps to use or integrate the snippet.

Snippets should be copy-paste friendly and avoid hard-coded secrets.
